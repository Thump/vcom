    name
        Determines the final video name, and the name of intermediate
        work directories.  This is a required attribute.

    size
        Determines the final video size.  This is a required attribute.

    bgcolor
        This is the default background color.

    scale
        All source images, absolute coordinates, and final video sizes
        are scaled by this: allows early drafts to be smaller and thus
        render more quickly.  This is an optional attribute, and defaults
        to 1.

    fps
        Determines the final video frame rate.  This is a required
        attribute.

    encoder
        This string must mean something to the back-end video encoder.
        This is a required attribute.

    encoderopts
        This string must mean something to the back-end video encoder.
        This is an option attribute, and defaults to "".

    sourceroot
        This is the parent directory of all image sequence and sound clip
        source files: this directory is prepended to all relative source
        directories.  This is an optional attribute, and defaults to "./".

    workroot
        This is the location of all non-transient intermediate files:
        files which may have use from one render to the next, but which
        need not be shared between renderfarm nodes.  This is an optional
        attribute, and defaults to "/tmp/vcom/<name>/work".

    finalroot
        This is the directory used for all non-transient intermediate files

        Each image sequence is a single sequence of images to be applied to
        the final video.  Because it can source non-contiguous
        frames and can target non-contiguous frames, it is best defined by
        being sourced from images in a single directory: multiple sequences
        can be sourced from a directory of source images, but any given
        sequence can only come from a single directory of images.  There
        must be at least one sequence defined.

            dir
                The directory which contains the files identified by the

                source files from within the directory identified by the
                dir tag.  Files which match the filter are included.  This
                tag is optional: if neither filter nor file is specified,

            file
                Mutually exclusive with the filter tag: this identifies
                a single video file which will be used as the source of
                images this sequence.  The valid
                file formats are those which will be recognized by the
                rendering backend.  This tag is optional: if neither
                filter nor file is specified, then filter is assumed.

            start
                This indicates the starting point in the source: it can 
                be represented as the number of frames offset from the
                beginning of the set of files of the first frame of the
                video (first frame is 0), or it can be the number of hours

                It is an optional attribute, and defaults to 0.

            loop
                This is a boolean attribute, and determines whether, once
                the end of the source has been reached, the sequence should
                loop to the beginning of the source.  It is an optional
                attribute, and defaults to a value of "false".

                This marks the final size of the cropt from the source
                image.  It can be specified in terms of absolute pixels,
                or in terms of a percentage of the source image dimensions.
                This parameter is mutually exclusive with sizestep: only
                one can be specified.  If neither are specified, then
                sizeend has a default value equal to sizestart.

            sizestep
                This indicates the change in the x and y size between
                each target frame insertion.  This parameter is mutually
                exclusive with sizeend.

            sizestepinc
                This indicates the change in the sizestep value between
                each target frame insertion.  It is an optional attribute,
                and has a default value of "0x0".

            The source tag specifies the file from which a clip is
            sourced.  The source tag is mandatory.

            dir
                The directory which contains the file identified by the
                file tag.  If it is a relative path, the
                video.sourceroot tag will be prepended to it.  This tag
                is optional, and defaults to "./".

            file
                This identifies
                a single file which will be used as the source of
                sound for this clip.  The valid
                file formats are those which will be recognized by the
                rendering backend.  This tag is mandatory.

            start
                This indicates the starting point in the source, represented
                as the number of seconds (including fractional seconds)
                from the beginning of the sound file.  This attribute is
                optional, and has a default value of "0".

            end
                This indicates the ending point in the source, represented
                as the number of seconds (including fractional seconds)
                from the beginning of the sound file.  This attribute
                is optional, and has a default value of the length of
                the file less the start time.

            loop
                This is a boolean attribute, and determines whether, once
                the end of the source has been reached, the clip should
                loop to the beginning of the source.  It is an optional
                attribute, and defaults to a value of "false".

            loopstart
                If loop is true, then this determines where in the source
                the loop will restart from: it is used to set the start
                point of all subsequent iterations through the source set
                after the first one.  It is specified using the same syntax
                as for the start attribute.  It is an optional attribute,
                and defaults to the value of start.

            loopend
                If loop is true, then this determines where in the source
                the loop will end: it is used to end the loop for all
                iterations after the first one.  It is specified using the
                same syntax as for the end attribute.  It is an optional
                attribute, and defaults to the value of end.

            loopcount
                This determines the number of times the loop will iterate.
                This attribute is optional, and defaults to unlimited.

            The target tag is the mechanism by which the source clip is
            targetted into the final video.  If the source clip is longer
            than the targeted period, then the clip is terminated at the
            end of the target period.

            start
                This attribute is the time from the beginning of the target
                video (in fractional seconds) at which the clip should start
                to be inserted.  It is an optional attribute, and defaults
                to "0".

            end
                This attribute is the time from the beginning of the target
                video (in fractional seconds) when the insertion should stop.
                It is an optional attribute: if it is not specified, the
                source images will be continually inserted until there are
                no more source images.  Note however, that by using the loop
                value in the source tag and an unspecified target end, the
                target frames could become very large.

            rate
                This attribute is a sound frequency scalar, allowing the
                clip to be inserted at a higher frequency than the original.
                It is expressed as a (possibly fractional) multiple of the
                original frequency.  It is an optional attribute, and has a
                default value of 1.
