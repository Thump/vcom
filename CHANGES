---------------------------------------------------------------------------

September 3, 2007
Denis McLaughlin
 - finished adding code printing changes to RenderVideo code
 - still need to add it to sound render


September 2, 2007
Denis McLaughlin
 - changed naming scheme for render classes: Render<type>_<subtype>,
   so for example, RenderFrames_imagemagick is the imagemagick renderer
   for frames
 - added third role, encoding
 - merged farm code (printing commands) into native render classes
 - work/videonames still not being produce correctly :(

September 1, 2007
Denis McLaughlin
 - merged VComProcess and VComRender into a single VCom class
 - that single class can now be called with -p or -r to just process, or
   just render, by default it does both
 - also changed it so the processing determines the location of the
   frames.xml file from the video.xml file
 - changed LinuxSoundRender to exit early if there are no sounds
 - tweaked transcode command to not use -k anymore (what did it used
   to do?  it's a mystery, a mystery...)
 - tweaked processing output to keep the frame count on the screen after
   completion

August 31, 2007
Denis McLaughlin
 - tweaked ImageClip.toString() to print string version of Parameters
 - finished removal of all xposition, yposition, opacity, rotation,
   xsize, and ysize values: fully using parameters, yay me!
 - hmm, had to reintroduce defaults into the render classes, not the
   best way to do it :( 

August 30, 2007
Denis McLaughlin
 - fixed up recursive validation check in ImageClip
 - made sourceseq a mandatory sequence

August 29, 2007
Denis McLaughlin
 - tweaked Parameter valid testcase
 - changed ImageClip to correctly parse and store Parameters
 - added ImageClip test cases to tests Parameters: set, get, and override
 - tweaked some of the source formatting for smaller q1 screen
 - removed version and last modified date from source files

August 27, 2007
Denis McLaughlin
 - added TestParameter class

August 26, 2007
Denis McLaughlin
 - added Parameter class, preparatory to removing specific seqs from 
   ImageClip

version 0.6 complete
version 0.5 complete

November 29, 2006
Denis McLaughlin
 - added a property for the final frame type, vcom.render.frame.type, set
   to the text string of the image type, for example jpg or png

November 24, 2006
Denis McLaughlin
 - added frame count to processing

November 19, 2006
Denis McLaughlin
 - added -f option to ln command
 - tweaked logic for generating the final-images version
 - changed type of final images to be png

November 16, 2006
Denis McLaughlin
 - added getopt.jar file
 - added support for -f, -s, and -v
 - changed existing -f option to -m
 - implemented new frame render class, LinuxFarmFrameRender
 - added support to specify the frame render class with the
   vcom.render.frame.class property: i teh r0x0r!

November 15, 2006
Denis McLaughlin
 - changed render to print commands rather than run them
 - added a variable for the version in build.xml
 - added support for rendering frames to a command file

version 0.4 complete

August 7, 2006
Denis McLaughlin
 - moved valid() from sub-class to Seq
 - added a typeValid() in Seq sub-class

August 5, 2006
Denis McLaughlin
 - changed Seq to abstract class
 - changed Seq class to SeqLoop, extending Seq
 - fixed ImageClip and TestImageClip to match above changes
 - moved TestSeq to TestSeqLoop

July 23, 2006
Denis McLaughlin
 - added a max frame for rendering and encoding
 - changed encoder to encode only rendered frames (still broken cus
   of batches?) 

July 19, 2006
Denis McLaughlin
 - added status output as frames are rendered

version 0.3 complete

September 26, 2005
Denis McLaughlin
 - added a length option to image clips, to specify the maximum length
   of the clip

August 22, 2005
Denis McLaughlin
 - changed final frame type to jpg, since the alpha channel in
   the png messes up the transcode xvid encoder

July 26, 2005
Denis McLaughlin
 - fixed bug in date stamping of images
 - refactored frame and video rendering into different classes, covered
   by different interfaces: allows mix and matching of rendering engines
 - added property file vcom.properties, read from the current directory
 - added sound processing: ewf files are created for the sounds

July 25, 2005
Denis McLaughlin
 - added re-rendering if video header changes
 - changed from using tccat to avimerge, since tccat was merging as an
   mpeg (?)

July 22, 2005
Denis McLaughlin
 - debugged conditional encoding of videos
 - added stats for video encoding
 - added test cases for conditional encoding of videos

July 20, 2005
Denis McLaughlin
 - removed tmpRoot attribute: everything gets stuck in workRoot, except
   for the final video, which is in finalRoot
 - added bgcolor attribute to video: this is the default background
   color
 - base image of each frame is a composite of the initial image over
   a image that is the xsize x ysize and bgcolor

July 19, 2005
Denis McLaughlin
 - added routine to encode video

July 17, 2005

 - added TestUtil class to hold some common utility classes
 - began implementation to propagate image dates from old frames file

July 13, 2005
Denis McLaughlin
 - separated render code into its own class, and implemented a VComRenderI
   interface: this means other render classes (for Windows or whatever)
   could be written
 - initial implementation of VComLinuxRender test class

July 12, 2005
Denis McLaughlin
 - got rendering code working
 - added code to conditionally render based on file age: still need
   to add code to propagate image dates from one frames file to the next
