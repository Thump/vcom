---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  November 29, 2006

   - added frame count to processing

  November 19, 2006

  November 15, 2006
  Denis McLaughlin

   - added a variable for the version in build.xml
   - added support for rendering frames to a command file

version 0.4 complete

  August 7, 2006
  Denis McLaughlin
   - moved valid() from sub-class to Seq
   - added a typeValid() in Seq sub-class

  August 5, 2006
  Denis McLaughlin
   - changed Seq to abstract class
   - changed Seq class to SeqLoop, extending Seq
   - fixed ImageClip and TestImageClip to match above changes
   - moved TestSeq to TestSeqLoop

  July 23, 2006
  Denis McLaughlin
   - added a max frame for rendering and encoding
   - changed encoder to encode only rendered frames (still broken cus
     of batches?) 

  July 19, 2006
  Denis McLaughlin
   - added status output as frames are rendered

version 0.3 complete

  September 26, 2005
  Denis McLaughlin
   - added a length option to image clips, to specify the maximum length
     of the clip

  August 22, 2005
  Denis McLaughlin
   - changed final frame type to jpg, since the alpha channel in
     the png messes up the transcode xvid encoder

  July 26, 2005
  Denis McLaughlin
   - fixed bug in date stamping of images
   - refactored frame and video rendering into different classes, covered
     by different interfaces: allows mix and matching of rendering engines
   - added property file vcom.properties, read from the current directory
   - added sound processing: ewf files are created for the sounds

  July 25, 2005
  Denis McLaughlin
   - added re-rendering if video header changes
   - changed from using tccat to avimerge, since tccat was merging as an
     mpeg (?)

  July 22, 2005
  Denis McLaughlin
   - debugged conditional encoding of videos
   - added stats for video encoding
   - added test cases for conditional encoding of videos

  July 20, 2005
  Denis McLaughlin
   - removed tmpRoot attribute: everything gets stuck in workRoot, except
     for the final video, which is in finalRoot
   - added bgcolor attribute to video: this is the default background
     color
   - base image of each frame is a composite of the initial image over
     a image that is the xsize x ysize and bgcolor

  July 19, 2005
  Denis McLaughlin
   - added routine to encode video

  July 17, 2005
  Denis McLaughlin
   - finished forward propagating dates in cases where the image xml
     hasn't changed and when it has
   - added tests for the image date propagation

  July 15, 2005
  Denis McLaughlin
   - added Util class to hold some common utility classes
   - added TestUtil class to hold some common utility classes
   - began implementation to propagate image dates from old frames file

  July 13, 2005
  Denis McLaughlin
   - separated render code into its own class, and implemented a VComRenderI
     interface: this means other render classes (for Windows or whatever)
     could be written
   - initial implementation of VComLinuxRender test class

  July 12, 2005
  Denis McLaughlin
   - got rendering code working
   - added code to conditionally render based on file age: still need
     to add code to propagate image dates from one frames file to the next

  July 11, 2005
  Denis McLaughlin
   - added frame processing to ImageClip
   - added frames processing to Video
   - ready to start on rendering script
