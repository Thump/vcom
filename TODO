 - ssh farm
 x status list of frames as generated
 - vcomrender called with same xml as vcomprocess
 - get size working
 x render up to certain frame, encode only up to certain frame
 - ability to refer to len, start, and stop of a frame sequence by name,
   rather than munging around with variables: have to watch for recursion
 - remove attribute specific tags: make them generic, with
   a name which the renderer maps to a switch, and different types of
   sequences, floating, integer, pair, matrix
   <seq type="float" name="rotation" start, stop, loopstart, loopstop,
    step, loopcount, length>
 - add support for interpolated seqs: provide data points, define interpolating
   algorithm (linear, linear-easeI, linear-easeO, linear-easeIO, spline)
 - frame independent effects: fade in, fade out, mathmap; maybe have to
   separate composite operations from final frame stuff

<seq attribute="rotate"
     value="int|float|floor|round"
     type="1d|2d|3d|matrix"
     algorithm="linear|spline|quaternion"

     start="" stop="" step="" loopcount="" loopstart="" loopstop=""
